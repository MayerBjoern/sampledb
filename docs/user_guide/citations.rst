Objects
-------

If you wish to reference a specific sample, measurement or simulation in an instance of SampleDB, you can use its URL, e.g. ``https://iffsamples.fz-juelich.de/objects/0``. Bear in mind, however, that users need to be signed in even to view public objects.

An alternative to this would be to publish the information using :ref:`Dataverse <dataverse_export>` or uploading the information to a service such as `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_.
